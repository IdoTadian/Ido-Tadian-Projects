# Data Base - Power BI
**Description:**
This project showcases the final stage of a database design and analysis project completed during my academic studies.
The uploaded Power BI file presents interactive dashboards based on a database I designed, built, and populated.
It includes management-level and operational-level views, providing KPIs, trends, and detailed insights based on the data.
The project involved:
Designing an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on organizational workflows.
Creating relational database tables and generating realistic sample data using Excel.
Writing advanced SQL queries (including nested queries, window functions, and CTEs) for data analysis.
Visualizing the results in Power BI with two dashboards, each tailored to different organizational needs.
Note:
This repository contains the final Power BI dashboards only.
The database structure, queries, and data generation process were part of the full academic project.

**Technologies Used:**
SQL, Power BI, Excel
