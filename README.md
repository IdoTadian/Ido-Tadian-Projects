# Dashboard - Power BI
**Description:**
This project showcases the final stage of a database design and analysis project completed during my academic studies.
The uploaded Power BI file presents interactive dashboards based on a database I designed, built, and populated.
It includes management-level and operational-level views, providing KPIs, trends, and detailed insights based on the data.
The project involved:
Designing an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on organizational workflows.
Creating relational database tables and generating realistic sample data using Excel.
Writing advanced SQL queries (including nested queries, window functions, and CTEs) for data analysis.
Visualizing the results in Power BI with two dashboards, each tailored to different organizational needs.
Note:
This repository contains the final Power BI dashboards only.
The database structure, queries, and data generation process were part of the full academic project.

**Technologies Used:**
SQL, Power BI, Excel


# Business Intelligence & Analytics â€“ Tableau

This project involved the complete design and implementation of a Business Intelligence & Analytics (BI&A) solution for a fictional bicycle and accessories retail company, with the goal of enabling better, data-driven decision-making at all organizational levels.

### Phase 1: Data Warehouse Design
- Built a full-scale **Data Warehouse** from scratch, based on business needs, using a **Star Schema** model.
- Identified and defined **fact tables** (e.g., sales transactions) and multiple **dimension tables** (e.g., customers, products, time).
- Performed **data aggregation and transformation** where necessary to optimize performance and usability.
- Defined and calculated **critical business KPIs** (Key Performance Indicators) aligned with strategic and operational goals.

### Phase 2: BI Applications Development in Tableau
- Developed **two business reports**:
  - A **strategic-level report** supporting long-term decision-making.
  - A **tactical-level report** aimed at operational performance improvement.
- Created a comprehensive **executive dashboard**:
  - Presented an overall organizational view with a focus on core KPIs.
  - Included **drill-down capabilities** to explore underlying causes of high-level metrics.
- Developed an **OLAP-style analysis tool**:
  - Enabled business users to perform **multi-dimensional slicing and dicing** using pivot tables.
  - Used **Data Storytelling** techniques to highlight key insights.

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytical Investigation
- Conducted **confirmatory data analysis** to answer business-critical questions using statistical methods:
  - Performed **ANOVA**, **T-Tests**, and **Chi-square tests** for hypothesis testing.
  - Combined **diagnostic and descriptive analytics** to generate actionable insights.

**Tools & Technologies:**  
Tableau, SQL, Data Modeling (Star Schema), Data Warehousing, Pivot Tables, Excel, Statistical Analysis (ANOVA, T-Test, Chi-square), Data Storytelling
